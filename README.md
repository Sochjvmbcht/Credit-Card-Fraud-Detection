Credit Card Fraud Detection| ML

1. Read Data
In this section, the data is loaded into your environment. It typically consists of transactional records where some transactions are fraudulent. The dataset might include features like time, amount, and anonymized customer behaviors. This step helps in setting up the data for further analysis and modeling.

2. Explore Data
Data exploration involves understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset. This includes:

Checking for missing values.
Analyzing the class distribution (e.g., fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions).
Reviewing summary statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and correlation between variables.
Visualizing the data to detect any patterns or anomalies that could inform your modeling decisions.

3. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing is crucial to prepare the data for machine learning. Key steps include:

Handling any missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset.
Scaling or normalizing the features, especially for algorithms like Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Encoding categorical variables, if any, and ensuring the dataset is in a format that can be fed into the machine learning models.

4. Resampling Data
Fraud detection typically deals with imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are much fewer than legitimate ones. Resampling techniques, such as oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) or undersampling the majority class (legitimate transactions), help balance the dataset. Methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are commonly used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.

5. Handle Outliers
Outliers, especially in financial transaction data, can represent fraudulent transactions. Identifying and addressing outliers is important for improving model performance. Depending on the algorithm, certain models can handle outliers naturally, but pre-processing methods can also help manage them.

6. Build Models
Multiple models are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Each model has its strengths:

Logistic Regression: A linear model, often used as a baseline for classification tasks.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Well-suited for high-dimensional data and effective at separating classes.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy.
XGBoost: A high-performance boosting algorithm that sequentially improves weak learners.

7. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems like fraud detection. It estimates the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on a linear relationship between the features and the target.

Accuracy: 0.945946

8. Support Vector Machine
SVM separates classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes (fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions). It's effective in cases with high-dimensional data but can be computationally expensive.

Accuracy: 0.940541

9. Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. It works well for fraud detection due to its ability to handle large datasets and deal with imbalanced data. It is robust against overfitting and generally provides good predictive performance.

Accuracy: 0.935135

10. XGBoost
XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm known for its speed and performance, particularly on structured data. It builds a model in a sequential manner, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous models. XGBoost typically outperforms other models on tasks like fraud detection.

Accuracy: 0.951351

11. Fine Tuning
Fine-tuning involves optimizing the hyperparameters of each model to improve their performance. This could include adjusting the regularization strength in Logistic Regression, the number of trees in Random Forest, or the learning rate in XGBoost. Fine-tuning ensures that each model performs at its best.

12. Validation
Validation is used to assess how well the models generalize to unseen data. Cross-validation techniques help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. In fraud detection, additional metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are important since the dataset is imbalanced. These metrics help ensure that fraudulent transactions are detected without producing too many false positives.

13. Voting Classifier
A voting classifier combines the predictions of multiple models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to make a final prediction. The ensemble approach improves accuracy by leveraging the strengths of different models, thus leading to a more robust classification.
